    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix.</li>
        <li>Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, melted butter, and lemon juice until most of flour disappears into batter. Let batter sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with maple syrup and berries. Enjoy!</li>
